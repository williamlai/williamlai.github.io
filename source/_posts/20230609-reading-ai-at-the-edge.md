This is a comprehensive book with a certain level of depth, focusing on AI projects. It covers various aspects of edge AI, making it particularly suitable for project managers working in the field of edge AI. However, it is also highly relevant for AI engineers in general, as it provides insights into the factors that need to be considered for an AI product beyond just the technical aspects.

I pre-ordered this book at the end of 2022, and it wasn't until February 2023 that I received it. I started reading it intermittently in April and have finally finished it now.

In the second half of 2022, while I was exploring the products of Edge Impulse and Syntiant, my interest in Edge AI was reignited. Despite putting in considerable effort, I couldn't find a client-driven and worthwhile project to implement. Nevertheless, I still felt that dedicating time to Edge AI was worthwhile for me to continuously improve.

Although this book doesn't delve into coding, it reminded me of several important considerations when implementing AI projects. These insights make it easier to grasp and plan AI projects. I believe this book is suitable for anyone who has some exposure to Edge AI.
